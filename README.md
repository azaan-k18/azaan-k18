### Hello there 🫡

#### A Curious QA Automation Engineer

- ⚙️ Daily working with: `Java` · `javaScript` · `Python`
- 🌍 Actively exploring QA communities to learn and contribute if possible.
- 🔧 Building an **Automation Debug Analyzer** to make debugging faster and less painful.
- 💬 `ping` me about **automation**, **dev stuff**, **fantasy worlds**, or **gaming** — always up to learning new stuff about these.
